# Wordpress
This repo contains a variety of Wordpress code snippets that I use with the WPcode Wordpress plugin:

## replace_excerpt.php
This replaces the standard excerpt with an image (the featured image, or if there isn't one, the first image in the blog post) and a paragraph under a specified heading (in this example, an h3 heading with word "Limerick")
Set this to run everywhere, so that any time the excerpt appears, it is replaced with this excerpt
